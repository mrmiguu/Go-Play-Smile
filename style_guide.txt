FORMATTING:
- No classes should extend any other class; instead, a class should be created
  as a single reference variable.
- Due to the rule above, all classes will be final classes (no need to extend).
- Use the static & final keywords wherever possible (e.g. all formal method
  parameters should be final).
- Use the least amount of memory/size required when using primitive data types.
- Use the private access modifier unless you have a good reason not to;
  otherwise, use no access modifier for simplicity and encapsulation purposes.

STYLE:
- All indentation should be 8-spaces (set the tab width to a size of 8).
- All curly braces should align vertically.
        public static void main(final String[] args)
------> {
                // do something
------> }
- Blocks of code (loops, if-then & switch-case statements, nested classes, etc.)
  should have 1-space separating them from other lines of code around them.
- No newline at the end of file.
